* Define an annotation @Role that takes a String parameter (e.g., "ADMIN", "USER").
Annotate methods in a class with different roles.
Write a method that:
Checks if a user’s role matches the required role for the method and grants or denies access accordingly.
Simulate different role-based access by changing the user’s role and invoking methods dynamically.
