/*Annotation-based Test Runner
Create a custom annotation @Test to mark test methods.
Write a simple test runner that:
Finds and invokes methods annotated with @Test in a given class.
Reports the result (pass/fail) of each test and logs exceptions if any test fails.
This is similar to a mini-JUnit test framework.*/
